```

### Symbol Distribution
- **Classes with 50+ methods**: 23 classes (heavy functionality concentration)
- **Classes with 10-49 methods**: 147 classes (moderate complexity)

### Top Complex Classes (by method count)
1. **Ct1**: 254 methods (likely core framework class)
2. **B5**: 209 methods (major functionality hub)
3. **jIB**: 191 methods (complex business logic)
4. **J3**: 187 methods (high-level orchestrator)
5. **wDB**: 166 methods (data management layer)

## Decompilation Architecture

### Pipeline Components

1. **WebpackBundleAnalyzer.cs**
   - Analyzes bundle structure
   - Detects React components
   - Identifies tool implementations
   - Maps WASM integration points

2. **ModuleExtractor.cs**
   - Extracts individual modules from bundle
   - Creates directory structure
   - Generates manual editing templates
   - Auto-generates symbol maps

3. **ImprovedSymbolExtractor.cs**
   - Maps methods to parent classes
   - Tracks inheritance relationships
   - Identifies static methods and properties
   - Generates compact symbol reports

4. **DecompilationMapper.cs**
   - Learns from manual edits
   - Applies mappings to new versions
   - Handles context-aware symbol mapping
   - Supports incremental improvement

5. **SymbolRenamingMap.cs**
   - Stores learned symbol mappings
   - Handles context-sensitive renaming
   - Supports pattern-based mapping
   - Enables cross-version application

## Symbol Analysis Insights

### Obfuscation Patterns Detected

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Single letters (A, B, Q, Z): Generic parameters/variables
   - Three-char patterns (Wu1, Bx2): Functions/classes
   - Numeric suffixes (A0, A1, A2): Related functionality groups
   - Mixed case (ALB, BMB): Complex class identifiers

2. **Common Symbol Patterns**:
   - `*0`, `*1`, `*2`: Versioned or indexed functionality
   - `*A`, `*B`: Paired/related classes
   - `_*`: Internal/private indicators
   - `static *`: Preserved static method indicators

3. **Structural Patterns**:
   - Heavy use of CommonJS module pattern
   - React component patterns preserved
   - Error class inheritance visible
   - Event emitter patterns detectable

### React & UI Components

Detected React patterns in multiple classes:
- Component lifecycle methods
- State management patterns
- Event handler structures
- JSX createElement calls

### Tool Implementations Found

Evidence of Claude Code tool implementations:
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit)
- Bash command execution
- Web search/fetch operations
- Grep/Glob file searching
- Todo management
- Notebook editing

## Renaming Strategy Recommendations

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Identify and rename main application class
- Map React component hierarchy
- Rename core utility functions
- Document event system classes

### Priority 2: Tool System (Week 2)
- Map tool command implementations
- Rename file operation classes
- Document bash/shell interfaces
- Identify search/grep implementations

### Priority 3: Business Logic (Week 3)
- Rename domain-specific classes
- Map data flow classes
- Document API interfaces
- Identify state management

### Automation Potential

Based on analysis, we expect:
- **Initial manual work**: ~100 core modules
- **Automatic mapping**: 95%+ for subsequent versions
- **Pattern learning**: Strong naming convention consistency
- **Context awareness**: Same symbol different contexts handled

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2a)
1. Begin manual renaming of top 10 most complex classes
2. Focus on classes with clear functional patterns
3. Document renaming decisions for pattern learning
4. Test learning system with initial renames

### Short-term Goals (Phase 2b)
1. Complete core infrastructure renaming
2. Apply learned patterns to similar classes
3. Validate automated suggestions
4. Build comprehensive symbol dictionary

### Long-term Vision (Phase 3)
1. Achieve 95%+ automation for v1.0.99
2. Create public deobfuscation tools
3. Enable community contributions
4. Build version diff analysis

## Technical Debt & Challenges

### Current Limitations
- WASM functions remain opaque
- Minified string literals need context
- Some dynamic code generation patterns
- Circular dependencies complicate analysis

### Mitigation Strategies
- Focus on high-confidence mappings first
- Use structural matching over name matching
- Preserve mystery for ambiguous cases
- Leverage version diffs for validation

## Resource Requirements

### Manual Effort Estimate
- Initial decompilation: ~40 hours
- Pattern documentation: ~10 hours
- Validation & testing: ~10 hours
- Total Phase 2: ~60 hours

### Automation Benefits
- Version 1.0.99: ~3 hours (95% reduction)
- Version 1.1.0+: ~1 hour (98% reduction)
- ROI break-even: 2nd version

## Conclusion

The decompilation infrastructure is fully operational and ready for the symbol renaming phase. With 12,203 files extracted and comprehensive symbol mapping complete, we can begin the manual renaming process with confidence that our learning system will dramatically reduce effort for future versions.

The key to success will be thoughtful, consistent renaming of the initial core modules, which will train the system for highly automated processing of subsequent Claude Code releases.
